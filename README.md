# Metacart - a decentralized social media aimed to incentivize creators 

The present social media landscape is not very promising as it has several issues. 
Problems with the web2 social media ecosystem include the vast power held by a few 
corporations, platform monitoring, and transparency. Moreover, the algorithms used 
by these organizations are for their benefit and usually guide their users into a rabbit 
hole of consumption and polarization.
The existing social media revenue model runs on the attention economy, which 
involves platforms selling their users' attention for advertising. This game of attention 
forces these firms to indulge in unethical practices. These practices are causing us to 
become addicts of the platform and making our lives worse while dividing our society 
by agitating us and giving different individuals various versions of the same facts. 
Additionally, these platforms do not encourage creativity. We often see the content of 
small creators blatantly plagiarized by more popular creators without any real
consequences. Even the monetization models for these creators are very centralized 
which forces these creators to make polarizing content to earn money. 
A potential remedy is switching to a subscription-based model, which would 
enable businesses to control their relationships with customers, minimize addiction to 
participation, and stop toxic behavior like hate speech and the dissemination of false 
information and disinformation. But those who can not subscribe would have less 
access to crucial items like job listings and business tools, interpersonal connections, 
and access to information.
Therefore, we want to redefine the entire landscape of traditional social media and 
make it a place of the future with promising web3 business models involving NFTs 
and Cryptocurrencies. We tackle the data privacy problem by adopting a dual 
backend. We integrate web2 and web3 by storing user images on IPFS and keeping 
the hashes obtained on the blockchain. This helps small creators to stay protected as 
their proof of work is safe. Additionally, to prevent creators from catering to existing 
harmful algorithms, we have enabled monetization of their content by introducing 
peer-to-peer Micro-Tipping using Ethereum-based tokens. 
To simplify the ownership of digital assets, we have democratized the NFT 
minting process by enabling the minting of every user post with just a click of a 
button. Moreover, to give the buyer and seller the best price for the NFT, we 
incorporated our Dynamic Pricing Algorithm. This algorithm takes in the base price 
set by the user and marks up the price based on the virality and engagement of the 
post. This prevents the creators from underselling their NFTs. Further, these NFTs 
can be listed on our own NFT marketplace and will be open for commerce. The 
revenue model we propose is to leverage our tokens and let the network effects 
increase the value of the token. We are essentially removing the need for ads with our 
revenue model thereby ensuring user data privacy.
To summarize, the main contributions of this paper include:
 Providing advertisement-free social media that ensures user data privacy.
Leveraging smart contracts to maintain proof of work to encourage creativity 
among creators.
 Proposing a sustainable web3 revenue model by leveraging tokenomics.
Democratizing the process of creating and owning NFTs and pricing them 
with our proposed Dynamic Pricing Model.
Enabling micro-tipping feature to allow users to support their favorite 
content creators.
