# Metacart - a decentralized social media aimed to incentivize creators 

 Metacart is an ad-free, tracking-free, and creator-friendly web3-based 
social media powered by Cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Unlike current social 
media applications that track user activity, we ensure data privacy by leveraging 
decentralized IPFS storage. We use Ethereum-based tokens to facilitate content 
monetization through Micro-Tipping. This feature enables users to support their 
favorite creators by tipping apart from liking and sharing. We democratize 
digital asset ownership by minting each post into an NFT with just a click, 
which subsequently can be traded on our own NFT marketplace. Utilizing our 
proprietary Dynamic Pricing Algorithm, which gauges the value of the assets 
intelligently based on virality and engagement, we determine the price of NFT. 
In all the transactions, we use our tokens built on Ethereum to carefully 
construct healthy web3 business models that leverage tokenomics to create 
value for every party in a positive sum manner.
